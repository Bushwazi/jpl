			| - This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine. -
			br
			| - My website is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. -
			br
			| - My website, without me, is useless. Without my website, I am useless. I must layout my modules true. I must compress finer than my rival who is trying to minify me. I must render him before he lossy's me. I will... -
			br
			| - My website and I know that what counts in browsers is not the lines we write, the ease of our tween, nor the gradients we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit... -
			br
			| - My markup is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its APIs and its libraries. I will keep my code clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will... -

			tr
				td

			tr
				td
					img(src="/public/img/tools/jade.svg" alt="JADE")
				td Used as a templating engine via Gulp
				td Whenever I need to hand off HTML templates

				td Usually compiled via gulp

				td 
					| I've been cascading since before it was cool. "Do you use divs?" "You don't use tables?" And now there is no support for IE9. And FLEXBOX, flexbox.
					br

			tr
				td
					img(src="/public/img/tools/stylus.svg" alt="Stylus")
				td My favorite preprocessor.
				td Daily
				td Loops! Loose punctuation! No `ruby` in the title of terminal. Just a few reasons Stylus has quickly become my favorite. We'll see where it stands once I get into PostCSS...
			tr
				td
					img(src="/public/img/tools/sass.svg" alt="Sass")
				td Sass used to be the cool kid.
				td Daily
				td Sass is still on projects I work on, but not projects I start.
			tr
				td
					img(src="/public/img/tools/less.png" alt="LESS")

				td
					img(src="/public/img/tools/postcss.png" alt="PostCSS")
					br
					| PostCSS
				td This website is my first PostCSS build.

			tr
				th(colspan="4") FUNCTIONALITY
			tr
				td
					img(src="/public/img/tools/javascript.png" alt="Javacript")
				td Hand written, core language
				td Daily
				td I like knowing how the language works, so I use the core language, poach functions when I need them and polyfill when required.
			tr
				td Velocity.js
				td Contains the parts of jQuery I miss.
				td Daily
				td What do I miss from jQuery? animate(); slideUp(); slideDown(); Velocity's got it.
			tr

					img(src="/public/img/tools/jquery.png" alt="jQuery")
				td with lots of dollar signs

				td Since I abide by lean methodologies, I must start by making all animations as CSS as possible. stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset are my true allies.
			tr
				td Web Animation API
				td The future client API and the current polyfill. The WAAPI merges the animation engines of CSS and javascript into one, which makes JS animations much more efficient.
				td Occasionally
