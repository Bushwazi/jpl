There are many like it, but this one is mine. -<br>- My website is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. -<br>- My website, without me, is useless. Without my website, I am useless. I must layout my modules true. I must compress finer than my rival who is trying to minify me. I must render him before he lossy's me. I will... -<br>- My website and I know that what counts in browsers is not the lines we write, the ease of our tween, nor the gradients we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit... -<br>- My markup is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its APIs and its libraries. I will keep my code clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will... -<br>- Before W3C, I swear this creed. My internet and I are the defenders of our ideas. We are the masters of our clients. We are the requests of my life. -<br>- So be it, until victory is America's and there is no buffering, but peace! -</p></aside><table><thead><tr><th>TOOL</th><th>HOW</th><th>WHEN</th><th>QUE?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th colspan="4">MARKUP</th></tr><tr><td><img src="/public/img/tools/html.png" alt="HTML"></td><td>Hand written, snippets, patterns</td><td>Daily</td><td>I am a man of semantics.

I've been cascading since before it was cool. "Do you use divs?" "You don't use tables?" And now there is no support for IE9. And FLEXBOX, flexbox.<br>Do you remember when #d0d0d0; was the first shade of grey a monitor could pick up?</td></tr><tr><td><img src="/public/img/tools/stylus.svg" alt="Stylus"></td><td>My favorite preprocessor.</td><td>Daily</td><td>Loops! Loose punctuation! No `ruby` in the title of terminal. Just a few reasons Stylus has quickly become my favorite. We'll see where it stands once I get into PostCSS...</td></tr><tr><td><img src="/public/img/tools/sass.svg" alt="Sass"></td><td>Sass used to be the cool kid.</td><td>Daily</td><td>Sass is still on projects I work on, but not projects I start.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="/public/img/tools/less.png" alt="LESS"></td><td>LESS is javascript, which makes it cooler that Sass.</td><td>Daily</td><td>Somewhere in the middle.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="/public/img/tools/postcss.png" alt="PostCSS"><br>PostCSS</td><td>This website is my first PostCSS build.</td><td>In progress</td><td>I'm digging PostCSS.
